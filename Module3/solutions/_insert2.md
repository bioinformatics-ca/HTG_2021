Yes

In general we try to obtain the longest fragment with high precision (smallest SD)

  - The final size of the fragment is not a big issue if it's generally longer than the sequencing design (here 200bp) to avoid overlapp. That being said, longer fragment basically could help to catch larger SV events
  - The precision is important because smaller SD will allow detecting a wider range of SV events.
