PCR reactions (PCR duplicates)


Some clusters that are thought of being separate in the flowcell but are the same (optical duplicates - old illumina flowcell)


in the new illumina flowcell when the loading is low one fragement can propagate from one nanowell to another free neighbour nanowell (Clustering duplicates)
