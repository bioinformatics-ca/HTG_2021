By looking at INFO field we can understand the filter

 * `QD` stands for `Variant Confidence/Quality by Depth` which corresponds to the QUAL score normalized by allele depth (AD) for a variant.
 * `FS` stands  for `Phred-scaled p-value using Fisher's exact test to detect strand bias` which corresponds to result of a Fisher's Exact Test to determine if there is strand bias between forward and reverse strands for the reference or alternate allele.
 * `MQ` stands  for `RMS Mapping Quality` which corresponds to an estimation of the overall mapping quality of reads supporting a variant call.
