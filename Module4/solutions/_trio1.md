Most of the variant looks plausible. But some of them seems missing, for exemple:

 * chr1:17,882,695-17,882,837 - 2bp deletion variant is missing in NA12892
 * chr1:17,879,015-17,879,138 - the variant is call in NA12891 and some few reads seems present in NA12878 but not called
 * chr1:17,841,784-17,841,823 - the variant is call in NA12891 and some few reads seems present in NA12878 and NA12892 but not called. Addtionally there is an indel at the same location which is a strech of T. So the region is supicious.
