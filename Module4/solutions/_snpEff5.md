The MODERATE variant can be extracted using this command:

```
grep MODERATE variants/NA12878.rmdup.realign.hc.filter.snpeff.vcf
```


There are 4 MODERATE variants found.



2 of them are sequence features variants which means they are sequence variants that causes the reduction of a the 5'UTR. these vairaint could sometime lead to loss of exon.


The 2 other are missense variants which means a non-disruptive variant that might change protein effectiveness.
