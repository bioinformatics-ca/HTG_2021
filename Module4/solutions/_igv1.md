Yes most of them look believable, but sometime in region with lower coverage the call coul be more ambigous 

for example in region chr1:17,757,997-17,758,036 SNPs are supicious because 

  1. Only few read support them 
  2. Close proximity between SNPs
  3. Variant bases are on the same reads for both SNPs or on the edge of the read 
  4. The region is a long strech of `A` which is prone to misalignment
